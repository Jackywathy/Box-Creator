# Box-Creator
A repo to make boxes. All boxes must be box pins. Instructions not Clear



##Current Features:
**Creates a template of a laser-cuttable box, given**
- Length, Height, Breadth of Box
- Number of notches on Length, Height and Breadth
- Length of the notches on Length, Height and Breadth!
- Make notches slightly larger to fit into the slot, (can be specified, default 2mm)

*Also theres an auto-detect but its not very good*
- Takes Length, Height, Breadth and number of notches
- number of notches must be equal on all sides :(


##TODO
**GRAPHICS!**
**Generate Closed Boxes**
Code Refactoring (EZ?)
Make notch-fitting a little better by halfing it and applying to both sides

##License
NONE! use as you please.


MarkDown is Fun! (THX quadrupleslap!)
